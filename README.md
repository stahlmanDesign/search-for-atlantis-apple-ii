Beginnings of a game made on the Apple II in Feb 1988. The game runs in ProDOS and attempts to load the Beagle Compiler (not included) into memory.

<figCaption>Video capture of SFAFIX.BAS running with the Beagle Compiler in memory. Submarine visits background files 1-11 using the macOS emulator, Virtual ][. Backgrounds 12-27 did not fit on the disk with the main program, and are only viewable using a "viewer" utility program (all backgrounds are shown in the <a href='./screen-capture/sfa-all-screens-montage.png'>still montage</a>).
